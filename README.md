# weather-condition-app

A simple Python console application that fetches and displays current weather data for a given city using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
The application also keeps track of previously queried cities.

---

## Setup

1. Sign up to [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) to get your free API key.
2. Open the code and enter your own API key:
   ```python
   apikey = "ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```
3. Run the code using Python.

---

## Features

- Get current weather conditions by city name.
- View a list of previously queried cities.
- Outputs are displayed in Turkish (`lang=tr`) and use metric units (`units=metric`).
- Gracefully handles incorrect city names or network errors.

## API Info

This app uses the `/data/2.5/weather` endpoint from OpenWeatherMap.  
Example query:

```plaintext
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=istanbul&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric&lang=tr
```

- `q`: City name (e.g., `vienna`, `wien`, `viyana` â€” all supported)
- `appid`: Your API key
- `units=metric`: Uses Celsius and metric system
- `lang=tr`: Returns weather descriptions in Turkish

## Example API JSON Response

```json
{
  "coord": {"lon": 30.52, "lat": 50.45},
  "weather": [{"id": 800, "main": "Clear", "description": "clear sky", "icon": "01d"}],
  "main": {
    "temp": 283.35,
    "feels_like": 280.9,
    "temp_min": 283.35,
    "temp_max": 283.35,
    "pressure": 1023,
    "humidity": 60
  },
  "wind": {"speed": 3, "deg": 240},
  "clouds": {"all": 0},
  "sys": {"country": "UA", "sunrise": 1611562067, "sunset": 1611595751},
  "name": "Kiev",
  "cod": 200
}
```

This response is parsed in the code to extract:
- `"weather"[0]["description"]`
- `"main"]["temp"]`
- `"main"]["humidity"]`
